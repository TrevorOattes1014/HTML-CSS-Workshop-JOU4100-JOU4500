            <h1>Biography</h1>
              <p>I was born in Ottawa but raised in nearby Perth, Ontario. My childhood was very typical of your average rural Ontarian: spending time in county fairs, cottages and bonfires was the norm. While bonfires and cottages can be quite fun, I am not a fan of county fairs. There was a time at the <a href="http://perthfair.com/" target="_blank">Perth Fair</a> when I was around six years old that a man in a Mickey Mouse costume startled me so badly that I started crying and punched him in the stomach. I later found out that the man was the Mayor of Perth and that he had taken time out of his busy schedule to try and bring some joy to the kids in town. I have never forgiven myself. </p>

            <p>This foul    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclectus_parrot" target="_blank">creature</a> is Elmo. I met him on my first day at Parrot Partners. He screamed in my ear until I could not hear anything and then defecated on my jacket sleeve. But, should truth be told, Elmo may be the only parrot I have encountered with whom I hold a grudging respect. He was miraculously good in front of a camera and, if prompted by food, would spread his wings as wide as possible so that I could get the best shot. While the logical part of my brain knows that Elmo only did this for the treat, there is a small part of me that believes he wanted me to succeed in my parrot photography career. I'll never know for sure, however, as Elmo was eventually adopted and left the facility never to be seen again. I often wonder what happened to him, and if he is screaming and defecating on someone else. Ah, well, I suppose these things are better left in the past.</p>
