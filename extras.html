            <p>Sinbad the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaw" target="_blank">Macaw</a> is a name that, even after all these years, still leaves a shiver at the nape of my neck. Whereas both Bernie and Elmo were spiteful little creatures, Sinbad was over a foot tall and had a beak that could <a href="https://beakcraze.com/do-macaw-bites-hurt/" target="_blank">destroy fingers</a> if he was so inclined. And lord, was he often inclined. Imagine, if you will, a flying chihuahua with a pair of garden sheers for a face, and you will begin to understand Sinbad the Macaw. Silly human concepts like "decency" and "mercy" did not exist for this beast. As Parrot Partner's resident photographer it was a duty of mine to get shots of every bird in the aviary, and as such I frequently had to dance with the devil in order to snap a shot of Sinbad. The shot you see above is taken from a children's camp that was held in the aviary. Strangely, Sinbad was relatively docile around children and would even allow them to pet him. This behavior lulled me into a false sense of security more than once, and the fact that I still have ten digits is a miracle. </p>
