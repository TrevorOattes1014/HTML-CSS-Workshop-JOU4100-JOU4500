            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my homepage, where I primarily share photos of parrots that I took in the summer of 2019. Parrots are violent and wrathful creatures, so the purpose of this website is less to enjoy the pretty feathers but moreso to act as a warning to anyone foolish enough to approach these monsters. Never, ever forget that these hellspawn are the direct descendants of dinosaurs.</p>

            <h2>Photo Work:</h2>
            <p>Here we have Bernie. While Bernie certainly seems sweet and cuddly, on the inside he is a furious ball of carnage the likes have which could only be rivaled by a biblical plague. Behind those amber eyes lies an unquenchable and absolute disdain for all things human.  </p>

              <p>The job of feeding Bernie and the other birds within this room often fell to me and thus I have an intimate familiarity with this feathered felon. Bernie was talkative even among the other parrots, and would often say - after staring with those empty eyes for discomfortingly long time - "wanna play?" He would then unleash a wave of kamikaze strikes with the sole intention of forcing me out of the room. This bird has hurt me more than most people, and that is no small task.</p>
